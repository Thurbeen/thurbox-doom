local NAME = "doom"

--- The program pane. Letters, digits, `-` and `_` only: the name reaches a tmux
--- window name, which tmux parses as part of a target string.
local PANE = "doom"

--- The Doom package's working copy, inside the interface directory.
---
--- `thurbox-cli plugin install git+<url>` clones a plugin that carries a payload,
--- and the clone lands at `<interface dir>/<repository name>/` — so this is the
--- REPOSITORY's name, not the plugin's. It carries the pane, engine and WAD:
---
---     <interface dir>/thurbox-doom/engine/bin/linux-x86_64/doom
---     <interface dir>/thurbox-doom/wad/doom1.wad
---
--- Other platforms can name a compatible engine with the `program` setting.
local CLONE_DIR = "thurbox-doom"

--- The WAD the Doom package ships and plays by default, as the `wad` setting's
--- DECLARED default.
---
--- Relative, and declared rather than resolved at read time, because the settings modal
--- shows a declaration: an empty default reads as "no WAD" to anyone who has not read
--- the README, which is the wrong thing to tell them about the one file this package
--- delivers. Relative to the clone, so it stays true whatever the interface directory
--- turns out to be — resolution happens below.
--- `doom1.wad` rather than `freedoom1.wad`: it is DOOM as people remember it, which is
--- the point of a DOOM pane. Both ship; `wad/NOTICE.md` says what each one is and under
--- what terms, and switching is this one setting.
local PAYLOAD_WAD = "wad/doom1.wad"

--- A path inside the Doom package's working copy, or nil when the kernel has not
--- published where the interface lives.
---
--- Absolute on purpose. A program pane has no session and therefore no repository,
--- so the kernel runs it in the interface directory — a relative path would happen
--- to work today and break the day that changes.
---
--- The join uses `/` on every platform, so on Windows the result has MIXED separators
--- (`C:\Users\me\…\ui/thurbox-doom/wad/freedoom1.wad`). That is safe for a specific
--- reason worth stating rather than assuming: Windows file APIs accept both
--- interchangeably, and this string's only destination is a program's argv — the engine
--- opens it. It would stop being safe if it were ever handed to something doing its own
--- path parsing, which is the change to notice.
---
--- Only the TRAILING separator is normalised, and both spellings are stripped there,
--- because at the end of a directory path both are unambiguously separators. Interior
--- bytes are left alone: a backslash is a legal filename character on POSIX, so
--- stripping one anywhere else would rename somebody's directory. Written down because
--- a separator assumption has twice shipped green from Linux in the kernel this runs
--- on — the second time it broke every repository install.
--- The engine builds the Doom package ships, keyed as `thurbox.platform` reports a
--- machine: `os .. "-" .. arch`.
---
--- A list rather than a stat, because a plugin cannot look at the filesystem — so the
--- pane knows what was committed and can say honestly which machine it has nothing
--- for, rather than exec'ing a path that may not exist. Building for another platform
--- is `cd engine/src && make` and dropping the result in `engine/bin/<os>-<arch>/`,
--- after which this table is the only thing in the way: add the key.
local SHIPPED_ENGINES = { ["linux-x86_64"] = true }

--- Arguments the shipped engine needs, as the `args` setting's declared default.
---
--- `-iwad` is not optional for it: without the flag it searches the working directory
--- for a handful of well-known WAD names, finds none, and exits "Game mode
--- indeterminate" — which is what a bare path bought before this default existed.
--- Clear it if you point `program` at a port that takes a positional WAD instead.
